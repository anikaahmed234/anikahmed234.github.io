# My Portfolio Site (On process)


This is the repository for my personal portfolio site, which is hosted on GitHub Pages. The site showcases my skills, projects, and experience, and provides a way for potential clients and employers to learn more about me and my work.

# Site Structure


The site is structured as follows:

- Home: The landing page, which provides nav bar with some menus and links to the other sections of the site.

- About:  An overview of my skills, experience, and interests.

- Portfolio:  Here i will store my Projects, Assignments on Automation and documnets on Test cases etc. You will get a selection of my recent projects, including descriptions, screenshots, and links to live demos or repositories.

- SQA: Have a vision to write in brief about software testing as a mini blog. That might help others in their way.

- Contact: A form for contacting me, as well as links to my social media profiles.

The site is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is designed to be responsive and accessible on all devices.
